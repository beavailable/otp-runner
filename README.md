# otp-runner
This KRunner plugin allows you to generate Time-based One-Time Passwords (TOTP) directly from your KDE Plasma desktop. It's a simple way to access your OTPs for two-factor authentication (2FA).

OTP secrets are stored in KWallet under the default wallet which is "kdewallet" in a folder named "OTP Keys".

Although it's a python plugin, it won't be running until you use it and will automatically exit after two minutes of inactivity, so don't worry about the memory usage.
